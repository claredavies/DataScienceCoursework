# DataScienceCoursework

# Assignment 1 (Web Scraping and Analysis):
  This project compares the news span between the first two weeks of December 2019 and December 2020 from the New York Times.
  The articles are webscrapped from the New York Times website using a combination of Selenium and Beautiful Soup. The news title, news author, news date and news link were all stored.
  An exploratory analysis was then carried out on the data gathered and the following were charted: Number of Articles in 2019 vs 2020, Number of Articles Published per Day and Number of Words per Title. After this the articles titles in 2019 and 2020 were compared by topic.
  
  Then the user is be able to interact with the console and perform the following:
  • User inputs a topic name
  • User gets the list of relevant news articles (their ID, and title)
  • User picks one of the IDs
  • The code returns the URL to the news.
  
 # Assignment 2 (Student Grade Prediction with Random Forest and KNN):
  The aim of the project is to predict students’ final grades in an online course using 2 different classifiers, with data collected from a fully online nine-week-long course on machine learning. The classifiers chosen were Random Forest and KNN. Both classifiers were evaluated for their effectiveness and then compared against each other.
  
 # Assignment 3 (Twitter Sentiment Analysis):
This projects aims to look when and how and when anxiety is talked about over a week in Twitter. The data in this project will be gathered using the TwitterAPI in the last 7 days, searching for tweets containing the hashtag “#anxiety” with retweets filtered out. In order to overcome the rate limit the tweets will be searched for within the confines of the UK using the geolocation feature. This means there’s no problem gathering all the tweets over the course of a week quickly. This is also needed as if the location wasn’t specified, all the tweets would have to be gathered over the week for #anxiety in order to fairly compare the days of the week.
